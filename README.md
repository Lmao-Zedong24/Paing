# No Paing No Gain
## Baking Simulation VR Game built with Unreal Engine 5.

This is a ISART Digital school project focused on creating a stationary VR game. 
The team consisted of 4 game designers and 1 programmer. Our goal was to create a baking simulator that made use of the unique VR controls. 
The biggest challenge was integrating this underused technology with less online ressources.

We faced many challenges while making this game:
* Makinig use of the constrained space
* The integration of the VR technology in UE5
* Not having a lot of online documentation concerning VR with UE5
* The merging between Blueprint and C++ code
* Making compromises du to VR's innate limitations
